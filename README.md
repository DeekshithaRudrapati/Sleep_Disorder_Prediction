Project Title: Sleep Disorder Prediction

Objective: To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting sleep disorders based on various health and lifestyle factors.

Dataset: Utilized a dataset containing information on gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, and daily steps.

Methodology:-

Data Preprocessing:
Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder.
Handled potential multi-label classification scenarios.

Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Implementation:

Trained various machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated models on the testing set using accuracy as the metric.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

Abstract
This project aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting sleep disorders. A dataset containing various health and lifestyle factors was utilized. The model was trained and evaluated using a combination of Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The best-performing model, [insert best model name], achieved [insert accuracy score] accuracy on the testing set. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing sleep disorders based on patient data.
